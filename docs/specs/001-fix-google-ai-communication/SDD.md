### Implementation Examples

**Purpose**: Provide strategic code examples to clarify complex logic, critical algorithms, or integration patterns. These examples are for guidance, not prescriptive implementation.

**Include examples for**:

- Critical algorithms or calculations
- Non-obvious integration patterns
- Security-sensitive implementations
- Performance-critical sections

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there complex areas that would benefit from code examples? If not, remove this section]

#### Example: [Complex Business Logic Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this specific example helps clarify the implementation]

```typescript
// Example: Discount calculation with multiple rules
// This demonstrates the expected logic flow, not the exact implementation
function calculateDiscount(order: Order, user: User): Discount {
  // Business rule: VIP users get additional benefits
  const baseDiscount = order.subtotal * getBaseDiscountRate(user.tier);
  
  // Complex rule: Stacking discounts with limits
  const promotionalDiscount = Math.min(
    order.promotions.reduce((sum, promo) => sum + promo.value, 0),
    order.subtotal * MAX_PROMO_PERCENTAGE
  );
  
  // Edge case: Never exceed maximum discount
  return Math.min(
    baseDiscount + promotionalDiscount,
    order.subtotal * MAX_TOTAL_DISCOUNT
  );
}
```

#### Example: [Integration Pattern Name]

**Why this example**: [Explain why this pattern is important to document]

```python
# Example: Retry pattern for external service integration
# Shows expected error handling approach
async def call_payment_service(transaction):
    """
    Demonstrates resilient integration pattern.
    Actual implementation may use circuit breaker library.
    """
    for attempt in range(MAX_RETRIES):
        try:
            response = await payment_client.process(transaction)
            if response.requires_3ds:
                # Critical: Handle 3D Secure flow
                return await handle_3ds_flow(response)
            return response
        except TransientError as e:
            if attempt == MAX_RETRIES - 1:
                # Final attempt failed, escalate
                raise PaymentServiceUnavailable(e)
            await exponential_backoff(attempt)
        except PermanentError as e:
            # Don't retry permanent failures
            raise PaymentFailed(e)
```

#### Test Examples as Interface Documentation

[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Can unit tests serve as interface documentation?]

```javascript
// Example: Unit test as interface contract
describe('PromoCodeValidator', () => {
  it('should validate promo code format and availability', async () => {
    // This test documents expected interface behavior
    const validator = new PromoCodeValidator(mockRepository);
    
    // Valid code passes all checks
    const validResult = await validator.validate('SUMMER2024');
    expect(validResult).toEqual({
      valid: true,
      discount: { type: 'percentage', value: 20 },
      restrictions: { minOrder: 50, maxUses: 1 }
    });
    
    // Expired code returns specific error
    const expiredResult = await validator.validate('EXPIRED2023');
    expect(expiredResult).toEqual({
      valid: false,
      error: 'PROMO_EXPIRED',
      message: 'This promotional code has expired'
    });
  });
